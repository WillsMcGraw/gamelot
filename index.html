        Hi, my name is Wills McGraw and this is the Game Lot. It's a personal project of mine where 
        I'll slowly add more and more games to it as practice for coding. I'll be starting with simpler
        games such as Tic Tac Toe or Minesweeper, and eventually maybe I'll add more complex games as 
        my own skill with coding increases. It's a little barren for but hopefully it'll turn
        into something more!
